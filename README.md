# dataParser
This is a dataParser I wrote to generate a wordlist off of a site
The code is not simple to edit, but it is not hard either
Read through it if you want to edit it
Make sure to change the directory

==============BUG================
The data I parsed generated the list I wanted
But most of the words have extra characters 
at the beginning 
If you run it you will see that it generates 
words that start like this:
> word
"> word

Keep that in mind when generating
It can be fixed easily
you can write a function
or you can paste the wordlist into 
MS Word and ctrl+H to remove them
